# Joystick-Controlled-Servo

This project aimed to create a synchronous system that accurately allows a joystick to control the movement of a servo motor. A PIC microcontroller was utilised and programmed using assembly to allow for communication between the components. Communication and control between the components was achieved by configuring the ADC and PWM modules of the microcontroller, as the values stored in the ADC registers play a vital role in varying the pulse width of the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Thus, allowing the joystick to control the servo.
